# Linnanmaa Weather

The Linnanmaa weather app for Android. A demonstration of HTTP and AsyncTask programming with Java in Android.

Also demonstrates how to localize an Android app to two languages (fi and se).

Fetches the JSON from https://weather.willab.fi/weather.json and extracts the current temperature, humidity and air pressure from the file.

Original implementation updated with new HTTP APIs after AndroidHttpClient deprecated (Antti Juustila). Also changed XML to JSON by Antti Juustila (2020).
